Push_Swap ♻️

This project is all about algorithmic thinking and mastering stacks — how to implement them, manipulate them, and store data efficiently.
🧠 What I Learned:

    How stacks work and how to implement them using arrays

    Performing key stack operations (push, pop, swap, rotate, etc.)

    Designing an algorithm to sort a stack of numbers using a limited set of moves and a second empty stack

🔍 My Approach:

In my project, I used arrays to implement the stacks.
To sort the numbers, I used a strategy based on chunk sorting, also known as the range algorithm — grouping values into chunks and sorting them efficiently through controlled pushes and rotations.
✅ Checker:

You can test whether your algorithm is sorting the stack correctly using the checker files provided in this repository.
